	<h1>The most complicated writing system</h1><hr>

		<section>
			<h3>Japanese</h3>
			<p> The Japanese writing system is probably the most complex in the world. It is made up from three scripts that are used in concert. The language uses two syllabaries of 46 characters alongside a logographic system of chinese origin.</p><br>

			<h4>Hiragana ひらがな</h4>
			<p>Hiragana is used for vocabulary items that have no kanji (Chinese characters) or when the writer does not know the kanji. This syllabary is also used for inflection and particles. These show what part a word plays in a sentence. Hiragana is capble of representing the language in its entirety and is most used due to its flexibility.</p>

			<h4>Kanji - Chinese characters 漢字</h4>
			<p>Kanji are chinese characters that were imported into the Japanese writing system. Kanji is used for vocabulary when there is a dedicated character available and known by the writer. The logographic symbols that make up the kanji have specific meanings but multiple pronunciations. </p>

			<h4>Katakana カタカナ</h4>
			<p>Katakana is used for foreign words or when the pronunciation is to be emphasized. This script is a later addition to the writing system that was meant to simplify it, but ended making it more complex. While the script is different, the pronounciations and uses are exactly the same as the hiragana.</p>
